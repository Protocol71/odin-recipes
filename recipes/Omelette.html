        <h2>The Omelette</h2>
        <p>As probably most of you know, an Omelette is a folded egg dish with fillings such as ham, vegetables and mushrooms.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
            <li>Desired fillings</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Crack the eggs into a bowl, add salt, pepper then whisk it.</li>
            <li>Spray a non-stick skillet with oil then pour in the mixture.</li> 
            <li>As eggs set around the edge of the skillet, push the cooked part towards the middle of skillet.</li>
            <li>When eggs start to fully set, put fillings on one half and flip the other over it.</li>
            <li>Cook for around a minute, then serve the omelette onto plate.</li>
        </ol>
