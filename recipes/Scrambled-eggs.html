        <h2>The Scrambled Eggs</h2>
        <p>Scrambled eggs is a recipe from at least the 14th century where eggs are stirred on heat in a way that they form curds.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
            <li>1 tbs butter</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Put cracked eggs, salt and pepper in a bowl then whisk them together.</li>
            <li>Melt the butter in an already heated non-stick pan.</li> 
            <li>Pour in the egg mixture and stir frequently.</li>
            <li>When the eggs are softly set, turn the heat off and leave it for a bit.</li>
